Data Challenge 1: Classifying Electronics Reviews

Authors: Jacob Farner and Leopold Ringmayr


To run the project, run the file model.py.

To run the classifier, the folders "neg" and "pos" should be in a folder named DC1--the directory paths are from the PyCharm project folder (the project directory is the root).

The file secondmodel.py can be run for the additional logistic regression model. 

The Naive Bayes Classifier prints model accuracy on the test set, along with precision, recall, and the F-Score. The output also shows the 10 most informative features.
